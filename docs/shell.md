Random useful shell commands that I've totally forgotten since leaving empeg.

Once you've got the player output, press Ctrl+C to quit to a shell. `rw` and `rwm`.

Because this is a developer build, I've got `d` and `g` as well as `player` in `/empeg/bin`.

## File structures

/drive0 and /drive1 are the mount points for the music partitions;

/empeg/fids0 -> ../drive0/fids
/empeg/fids1 -> ../drive1/fids
/empeg/var -> ../drive0/var


/empeg/var/config.ini
/empeg/var/database3
/empeg/var/playlists
/empeg/var/tags
